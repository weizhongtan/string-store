questions for phil:

* should i attempt to optimize storage using compression?
* how important is lookup time
* string validation - limitations on string length etc

design document:
* used express for it's ease of setup for micro-service servers
* two app methods: get and post
* mongodb store to store keys and values
* text values are hashed and stored with the hash as a primary key, this allows for extremely fast retreival
