Design choices:
* used express for it's ease of setup for micro-service servers
* two app methods: get and post
* mongodb store to store keys and values
* hash generated to be used as primary key to prevent duplicate strings in the database
* primary keys are indexed by

Possible to do:
* better string and id validation
* better testing
* compression
