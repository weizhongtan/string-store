Design choices:
* used express for it's ease of setup for micro-service servers
* two app methods: get and post
* mongodb store to store keys and values
* hash generated to be used as primary key to prevent duplicate strings in the database
* primary keys are indexed into a binary tree so that they can be searched in O(log(n)) time

Possible to do:
* store strings server-side as well for local implementation
* better string and id validation (to not accept additional object keys in post data)
* better testing (edge cases)
* compression
